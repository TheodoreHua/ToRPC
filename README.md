ToRPC is a Discord Rich Presence application designed for [r/TranscribersOfReddit](https://reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit)
users. The primary function of this is to show which post you're transcribing, info about said post, your session stats 
(as an eventual feature), and links to ToR as a Discord Rich Presence card.
